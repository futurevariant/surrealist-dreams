Welcome to the Lobster Lighting Sequence project repository

The project drives an LED lighting installation by using a hybrid arduino mega/ESP8266 board to receive JSON data over wifi and drive a relay.

The arduino sketch file is in the arduino/code section. This section also includes the dependencies as documented in the readme there.

The images folder includes an image of the wiring and jumper setup, and also includes an overview of the setup

The video folder contains an example animation sequence
